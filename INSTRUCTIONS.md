# Pick a Dataset

The next step for your dataset is to create an R package to make it accessible to others and to include a sample analysis that shows off the data and shares an insight.

I've stubbed out the structure for your data package using the DiscGolf example.
You will need to replace this through these files.

Here's a partial list of what's needed:

## Clone the repo in GitHub Desktop

## Open the project 

by navigating in RStudio to the folder for your project

## DESCRIPTION

Edit this file and replace with information about you and your package

## data-raw

This is the location for original data that gets processed into "data".
Please be sure to remove my files and replace them with your files
(and update GitHub accordingly).

Run your updated "DATASET.R" to populate your data in the "data" folder.

## data

Remove my old file and replace them with what is generated by "data-raw":
be sure to update GitHub as well.

## R

Rename the documentation (Rd) file and update with your information.

## Check your package

Using the "Check" button on the "Build" tab (see Environment, History, Connections, BUILD) confirm that your package passes the checks offered by "devtools::check()"
